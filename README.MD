**Note:** The `ViewStyle` and `TextStyle` types are imported from `react-native` and represent the style objects used in React Native for views and text, respectively.

**Tip:** If you have difficulties while applying `gap` or in any other style property to set a suitable space between the OTP input containers, please set the `width` in `containerStyle` to `'auto'` or `undefined`, as it is been set to `'100%'` by default.
